Claude and ChatGPT "Projects" fully enable the realization of AutoMuse!

# Instructions

Right now, the /Styles folder contains three styles that can be used as SYSTEM prompts or in the "Styles" feature of Claude. Both ChatGPT and Claude also have "project instructions" where these styles can be used, although that can be a bit of a pain. 

> This project does not cover the planning or outlining phase of writing. However, the `Mythic Brainstormer` style can easily be adapted to this as well, although I personally recommend not leaning too heavily on AI in the early phases of the conceptualization.

I typically have some brainstorming material and an outline in the project files, as well as one file for each chapter. For the "project instructions" I include some high level meta-information like the name of the book, my name, the logline of the story, and so on. 

## Mythic Brainstormer

This style has been refined over time (I actually use it all the time) to help identify mythic, archetypal, and cosmic patterns when planning scenes and chapters. The primary way to use this is to help see what the narrative demands from more mythic or archetypal perspective. Generally speaking, I only have 2, maybe 3, dialog turns with this at the beginning of a chapter just to get my bearings and talk through what I want to achieve with the given chapter or what the story demands and shape it to my authorial intent. 

## Scene Planner

This style came about as a way to help focus on specific details. The mythic brainstormer is great for broad structures, to provide a frame for the chapter. But this helps you drill down into specific details that you want to achieve. In other words, the chatbot can't read your mind so it needs to ask some questions to figure out what your intention is, specifically. 

## Drafter styles

Each drafter style is going to be specific to a given genre or prose style. Creating these prose style guides is an entire artform unto itself. But here are some rules of thumb:

- Use appeal terms that are specific to the literary industry.
- Use comp titles or authors to say who is closest to the style you're trying to achieve.
- Abide by the "don't think about pink elephants" rule - AI doesn't do well with negative instructions. So instead, just focus on what you want it to do (positive instructions)
